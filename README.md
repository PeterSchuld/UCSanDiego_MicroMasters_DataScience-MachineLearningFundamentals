# UCSanDiego MicroMasters Data Science Machine Learning Fundamentals
DES 220 "Machine Learning Fundamentals" (Spring 2019) by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. Understand machine learning's role in data-driven modeling, prediction, and decision-making. Part 3 in the »Data Science« MicroMasters®, completed 01-Sep-2019

About this course:
Do you want to build systems that learn from experience? Or exploit data to create simple predictive models of the world?

In this course, part of the Data Science MicroMasters program, you will learn a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, and the theory behind those algorithms.

Using real-world case studies, you will learn how to classify images, identify salient topics in a corpus of documents, partition people according to personality profiles, and automatically capture the semantic structure of words and use it to categorize documents.

Armed with the knowledge from this course, you will be able to analyze many different types of data and to build descriptive and predictive models.

All programming examples and assignments will be in Python, using Jupyter notebooks.

What you'll learn

    Classification, regression, and conditional probability estimation
    Generative and discriminative models
    Linear models and extensions to nonlinearity using kernel methods
    Ensemble methods: boosting, bagging, random forests
    Representation learning: clustering, dimensionality reduction, autoencoders, deep nets
